# DARKLY

Darkly is a 42 school project that is meant to be an introduction to web security, in the form of a CTF challenge.
We are provided a website in the form of a .iso file, that needs to be launched from a virtual machine.
This website contains several breaches and vulnerabilities. The goal is to find all 14 of them. Every vulnerability found and/or exploited reveals a flag.

All 14 directories in this repository represent a vulnerability, contain one flag, and ressources for this flag including a README.md that explains how the flag was found, what the vulnerability means and how to fix or patch it. It can also contain scripts or any other tools used in order to get the flag.
